# Test Case 1 - Upload a media file

## Steps

| Step/Instruction | Expected Result | Comment |
|------------------|-----------------|---------|
| Click on the **UPLOAD** button | A window with the file explorer opens | |
| Select a picture and press **open** | The file explorer closes and a card containing the picture appears after a short time. | There is a limitation on file types and file sizes for the Media module. If you select a file that violates these constraints, you should get a meaningful error message. |
| Upload a pdf in the same way | The file appears as card and in the preview there is the moryx logo with the text **No preview possible**. | |
