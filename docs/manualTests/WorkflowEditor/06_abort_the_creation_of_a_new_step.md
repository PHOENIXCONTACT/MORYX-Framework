# Test Case 6 - Abort the creation of a new step

## Expected preconditions

There is an existing Workplan that is currently opened in the Workplan Editor (as is the result of [test case 3](03_open_an_existing_workplan.md)).

## Steps

| Step/Instruction | Expected Result | Comment |
|------------------|-----------------|---------|
| Drag and Drop a step on the canvas | An area on the right site of the editor opens and displays input fields for the constructor parameter of the step. A placeholder for the step appears on the canvas at the location where the  step was dropped ||
| Click on the **Double Arrow** Button | The step area is replaced with the workplan properties area and the placeholder disapers. ||
