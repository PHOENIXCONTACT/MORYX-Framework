# Test Case 1 - Show available Steps

## Expected preconditions

There is an existing Workplan (as is the result of [test case 2](02_create_and_save_a_new_workplan.md)) and it is currently opened on the canvas.

## Steps

| Step/Instruction | Expected Result | Comment |
|------------------|-----------------|---------|
| Click on each of the expansion panels in the side navigation. | Each of the panels expands and shows several different steps in total. The step's classifications should match the headers of the expansion panels and the set of panels should be scrollable if the screen height is not sufficient. The steps should not be visible if there is no open workplan. ||
