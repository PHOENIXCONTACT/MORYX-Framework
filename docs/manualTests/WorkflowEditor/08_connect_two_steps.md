# Test Case 8 - Connect two steps

## Expected preconditions

There is an existing Workplan that is currently opened in the Workplan Editor with a **Test** step in it (as is the result of [test case 5](05_add_a_new_step_to_the_workplan.md)).

## Steps

| Step/Instruction | Expected Result | Comment |

| Click and drag an output of the **Start** card in the editor on the input of the **Test** node on the canvas and drop it there | A connection line appears between the two cards ||
| Move the **Start** card to a different position | The connection line keeps the adjustment  ||
