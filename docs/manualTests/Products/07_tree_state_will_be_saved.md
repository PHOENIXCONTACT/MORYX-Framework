## Steps

| Step/Instruction | Expected Result | Comment |
|------------------|-----------------|---------|
| Expand the node 'Housing' or 'CircuitBoard' | The imported types can be seen in the tree | |
| Change to **Resources** and then back to **Products** | The tree status (what is expanded and what not) remained unchanged | |
| Switch to the **hierarchic** view | The nodes 'Housing' and 'Large Housing' are located under the node 'HousingTypeBase' | Not yet included in the product model of the demo  |
| Expand 'HousingTypeBase' and reload the page | All expanded nodes stay expanded | |
