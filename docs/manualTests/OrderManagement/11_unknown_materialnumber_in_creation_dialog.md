# Test Case 11 - Add a unknown materialnumber in the creation dialog

It should be possible to type in an unknown materialnumber which will send to the backend with the creation context to have the possibility to test dynamic product data creation solutions.
The old ui allows to type in the material number directly in the combobox which will be used to filter but will use the number even if there is no product with this number.
