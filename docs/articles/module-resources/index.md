# Resource concept

Resources represent physical assets and logical objects like drivers within a cyber physical system. 
They can be coupled with active devices or represent passive objects like a table.
The main advantage of this concept is that the resource interface and implementation structure is the same for all resources. 
So [accessing a resource](ResourceManagement.md) is done in an abstract and general way. 
Processing, configuring and visualization of a resource is done in the same way with the same classes. 
Extending a default resource can be done in a standard way and includes expansion of the default UI as well.
