# Module Simulation

The simulation module provides functionality to simulate the behavior of physical machines in a production environment. 
It allows you to create virtual representations of physical systems, enabling testing and validation of workflows without the need for actual hardware.
By adding the simulation module and your custom [simulated drivers](./SimulationDriver.md) to your MORYX application you can run and test your workplans and your resources in a simulated environment.
To configure the simulation module you can use the [simulation parameters](./SimulationParameters.md) to influence the behavior of your activities during simulation runs.
To better understand the interaction with the process engine and other resources through the simulation module please refer to the [architecture documentation](./simulation_architecture_documentation.md).
