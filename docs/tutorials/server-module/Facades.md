# Facades

Facades are the runtime-way of interaction between server modules. 
This tutorial covers both ends of this concept - exporting a facade and importing a facade. 
To continue you should habe basic knowledge of server modules. 
The first steps of the subsequent example do not represent good code style and should not be used as a reference for facade design. 
Please complete the tutorial to get the right understanding of how facades work and how they are supposed to be used. 
We start by creating two server modules. 
Make sure to clear the facade entries on the first tab. Name one module `Facades.Dependency` and the othter `Facades.Dependent`. Your solutions should now look like this:

## Exporting a facade

In the first step we will create a facade and export it in our dependency module.
Creating a facade:

- Open the Facades.Dependency project and create a folder Facade
- Add an interface "IFacade.cs" to the folder
- Define a "Foo"-method in the interface that accepts two integers and returns an integer.
- Add a class "Facade.cs" to the folder and implement "IFacade" as well as `IFacadeControl`.
- Implement "Foo" by returning the sum of a and b

After we defined our facade, we want to export it from the server module. 
All we must do for this is to let our module controller implement the [IFacadeContainer](/src/Moryx.Runtime/Modules/IFacadeContainer.cs) interface. 
Add the "IFacadeContainer<IFacade>" interface to the module controller class and implement it at the bottom of the file:

```C#
public class ModuleController: ServerModuleFacadeControllerBase<ModuleConfig>, 
        IFacadeContainer<IFacade>
{
internal const string ModuleName = "ExampleName";
    
    /// <summary>
    /// Name of this module
    /// </summary>
    public override string Name
    {
        get { return ModuleName; }
    }

    private readonly Facade _facade = new Facade();
    IFacade IFacadeContainer<IFacade>.Facade => _facade;

    protected override void OnStart(){
        ActivateFacade(_facade);
    }

    protected override void OnStop(){
        DeactivateFacade(_facade);
    }  

    ...
}
```

It is important that the property *Facade* always returns the same object in order for the Runtime to function correctly.

The Facade property should be implemented explicit for a simple reason. If our module exports more than one facade it would have two properties with the same name but different type. While this is not possible for implicit class members, explicit interface implementations do not cause any conflicts.

## Importing a facade

Now that we have exported the facade, we want to use it in another server module. 
To do this our dependent module must reference the dependency module. In real world applications the facade interface will be located in a separate bundle library to reduce coupling of dependency and implementation.

Steps:

1. Reference the project "Facades.Dependency" and set CopyLocal to false
2. Add a property of type "IFacade" to the module controller
3. Decorate it with [RequiredModuleApiAttribute](/src/Moryx.Runtime/Modules/Management/RequiredModuleApiAttribute.cs).
   
    3.1 `IsStartDependency = true` will instruct the module manager to bind the dependent modules life cycle to the dependency ones

    3.2 `IsOptional = true` will allow this property to be null if no other module exports it. If this remains false the module manager will abort the boot process due to incomplete dependencies.

Your dependent module should look like this:

````cs
[Description("Example description")]
public class ModuleController : ServerModuleBase<ModuleConfig>
{
    internal const string ModuleName = "Dependent";
    
    /// <summary>
    /// Name of this module
    /// </summary>
    public override string Name
    {
        get { return ModuleName; }
    }
    
    [RequiredModuleApi(IsStartDependency = true, IsOptional = false)]
    public IFacade Facade { get; set; }

    ...
````

Of course a module can import more than one facade. Just add more properties of the facades you want to import and decorate them with RequiredModuleApiAttribute

## Importing many facades

Like with every DI-container the Runtime facade linker is able to inject a collection of instances if more than one component exports the interface. While most frameworks will leave you the choice of collection type. Currently collection injection only works with arrays. So far the dependency manager does not take collection injection into account when it comes to start dependencies. Therefor be careful when accessing the facades as the might raise InvalidHealthStateExceptions.
Usage in code:

````cs
[RequiredModuleApi]
public IFacade[] AllInstances { get; set; }
````

## Facade Design Guideline

## Bidirectional Communication

Occasionally the relationship between two modules requires bidirectional communication. The standard .NET way to to this is by using method calls from the dependent
to its dependencies and events/callbacks from dependency to dependent. 
The starting behavior of the Runtime, however, created problems in the kind of missed events
when the dependency raised events before the listener had reached the necessary state. 
After many long discussions including circular dependencies, three way handshake
and sacrificing kittens to the race-condition-god, we came up with a fairly simple solution. Events are supposed to propagate changes and should be used as such.

Every event invocation represents an incremental change that occurred within an object. An entry added to the collection or a modified property. Without the initial/
previous state of the object its current state can not be determined. 
Therefore, every API that offers events must also provide methods to retrieve the current state of the component. 

Transferring this to MORYX facades means that for every event there must be a way to retrieve the current state of the module. 
This decouples the life cycles and allows the dependent to be started and stopped at any time without having to worry what they might miss in the process. 
For example the API for a `JobManagement` could simply be:

````cs
/// <summary>
/// Facade of the JobManagement
/// </summary>
public interface IJobManagement
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Get current state of the job listener
    /// </summary>
    public IEnumerable<Job> CurrentJobs { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Retrieve a specific job by its Id. This includes all jobs, even finished and removed ones.
    /// </summary>
    public Job this[long id] { get; }

    public EventHandler<Job> JobStateChanged;

    /// <summary>
    /// Event raised when was finished and is removed from the list
    /// </summary>
    public EventHandler<Job> JobFinished;
}
````

## Lifecycle bound facades

Sometimes you need to know when a facade gets `activated` or `deactivated`. It's quite possible to get notified when the activation state of a facade has been changed.
Your facade should inherit from [FacadeBase](/src/Moryx.Runtime/Modules/ILifeCycleBoundFacade.cs) or at least from [ILifeCycleBoundFacade](/src/Moryx.Runtime/Modules/FacadeBase.cs):

````cs
public class CustomFacade : FacadeBase, ICustomFacade
{

}
````

Your last step will be to register to the facade event:

````cs
public class MyPlugin : IPlugin
{
    public ICustomFacade CustomFacade { get; set; }

    public void Start()
    {
        ((ILifeCycleBoundFacade)CustomFacade).StateChanged += FacadeStateChanged;
    }

    public void Stop()
    {
        ((ILifeCycleBoundFacade)CustomFacade).StateChanged -= FacadeStateChanged;
    }

    private void FacadeStateChanged(object sender, bool newActivationState)
    {
        // Do something
    }
}
````
