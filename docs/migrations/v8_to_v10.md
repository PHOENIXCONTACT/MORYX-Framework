# MORYX 8.x to 10.x

## Replaced result of visual instructions with dedicated result object

In *Moryx.Factory* **6.3** and **8.1** we introduced the new result object and optional extended APIs. The result object solved issues caused by localization of the different results. With **Moryx 10** we remove all old APIs based on strings.

## Replaced `IVisualInstructions` with `VisualInstructionParameters`
The interface was only used in `VisualInstructionParameters` which can and is being used as a base class in most cases anyway.
Hence, `IVisualInstructions` is removed in favor of a more extendable base class.
